Last week I brought up a discussion on Twitter about feelings I’ve been struggling with on femininity, appearance, and credibility in this industry. I was overwhelmed by the responses I got from many women who have felt the same way that I do. I encourage you to [read the thread](https://twitter.com/katiekovalcin/status/560813122382876672) and listen to these women’s stories.

Many women in this industry who I admire as being incredibly badass thought leaders also shared their stories about comments they’ve received at speaking engagements regarding their appearance. I was shocked. If women who are known for being smart, hard-working, talented, and have an impressive resume are still being scrutinized for their appearance, what chance does that leave for the rest of us?!

I struggle with the subconscious thoughts that many people have that “pretty” (or “feminine”) is mutually exclusive from “intelligent.” I know that many women prove this theory wrong, but it’s also exhausting to prove this every single time she takes the stage or enters a meeting room. [Sara Wachter-Boettcher](http://sarawb.com) shared an [incredibly powerful essay](http://faculty.georgetown.edu/tannend/nyt062093.htm), from over 20 years ago, about the “unmarked woman” that summarizes this idea.

I bring up this thread because it’s important. It’s important to recognize the daily hurdles that are placed in front of women just to simply be taken seriously in our profession. It’s important because as much as we wish it wasn’t, perception is everything. Of course professionalism is also important, but whether she chooses to paint her nails to express that professionalism is not. It’s important to notice next time you are seated next to a woman, if you are analyzing her appearance and not her thoughts. You must look past how she chooses to express herself and ask yourself “would I notice this about a man?” 

I posed the question based on my experience and enthusiasm for makeup. It was interesting to see that women were concerned with the opposite based on their experiences. Women who wear too much makeup, women who don’t wear enough makeup, women who have written books, women who are just entering this field, women who wear dresses, women who wear pants, women with short hair, women with long hair—_they all_ have felt the same way. It’s never enough, and it’s always too much at the same time.

Which leads me to believe that my appearance isn’t the problem. No matter how I portray myself, no matter how much work I do, I will still be judged because I am a marked woman. Which is both deeply upsetting, but wonderfully liberating.
