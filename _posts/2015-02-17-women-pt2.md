date:   2015-02-18 10:30:30
---

I’ve been adding more women to my timeline lately and it’s been WONDERFUL. The topics discussed, the jokes made, the gorgeous selfies—they’ve all made me enjoy being on Twitter again. And following a diverse crowd of women and hearing their experiences has made me more empathetic and notice my own privilege as a white woman. 

I can’t say enough good things about these women and what they’ve done for me by reading their tweets. Some are writers, a lot of them build websites, some are great resources, and I hope you start to follow all of them too. I’m often asked where to begin to find these amazing lady accounts to start following, so here is an alphabetical list of women who make my online life more enjoyable and why I enjoy following them.

(The list is long, so this is part 2 of a 3 part series)
