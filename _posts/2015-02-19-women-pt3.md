title:  "Amazing Women to Enrich your Timeline: Part 3"
date:   2015-02-19 10:30:30

I'm excited that so many people have found these lists useful, and I wish that I knew every amazing woman on Twitter and could add her to this list. Since this is unfortunately only the small segment of women that I have happened to follow and enjoy, I would love to open this up to an open source master list that anyone can add someone to (and include a reason why you like following them!).

If you have an idea for an open source list (GitHub?), or feel there is someone everyone should follow, please leave a comment!

(This is part 3 of a 3 part series. [View part 1](http://kovalc.in/2015/02/17/women-pt1.html) or [view part 2](http://kovalc.in/2015/02/18/women-pt2.html))
