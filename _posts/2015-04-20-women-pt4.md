title:  "Amazing Women to Enrich your Timeline: Part 4"
date:   2015-04-20 10:30:30
---

I've been extremely happy that so many people have used this list to expand their timeline to include amazing, smart, funny, talented women. Also, since it's still being used, I thought I'd update it to include some women who I've been enjoying since this is first published.

There's also a [GitHub](https://github.com/amirahaile/Amazing-Women-on-Twitter) repo that was created by [Amira Hailemariam](https://twitter.com/amirahaile) that you can PR and add to, to add your own favorite accounts to. This list is a super awesome resource, and I'm glad to see it still being updated by others!

However, for posterity on my own site, I wanted to include my updates as a post on here as well.
