As a way to say thanks, we created these custom letterpressed cards. I drew inspiration from the city of Cincinnati and the beautiful vintage typography that remains sprinkled throughout downtown. I created custom lettering for the mark, while also utilizing the letterpress medium to create a textural background for extra detail.
