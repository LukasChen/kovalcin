<p><a href="http://www.aecf.org" target="_blank">The Annie E. Casey Foundation</a> creates valuable resources for kids, families, and communities. The Foundation needed to surface their wealth of information in a responsive redesign. With a content first strategy, we developed a system that made meaningful changes to help users' find the information to help their cause.</p>
<p>
I designed a system with the content flexibility in mind. I designed a series of modules able to be used in a variety of content layouts. The design surfaces specific content in a more accessible way.
