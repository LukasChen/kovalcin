<a href="http://vimeo.com/34532174" target="_blank">Old Spice</a> wanted to create a Museum of Manliness to show off the brand's personality via the iconic Buoy Bottle design. I was able to have fun with the brand to create a space for an event to showcase everything Old Spice, including a "mandelier," 

I would just like to add this is the only time I can ever add "hand-shaved typography" to my role on a project.
